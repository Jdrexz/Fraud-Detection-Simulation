# Fraud Detection Simulation
This project simulates transaction data and trains a simple logistic regression classifier for fraud detection. It's intended as a starting point for feature engineering and model experimentation.

**How to run**
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `python main.py`

**Customize**
- Replace the synthetic data generator with your real transactions CSV.
- Add richer features (behavioral features, time-series patterns, device fingerprints).
- Replace LogisticRegression with tree-based models (RandomForest, XGBoost) for improved performance.
